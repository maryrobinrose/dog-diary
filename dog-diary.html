    <h1>My Life as a Dog</h1>
    <h2>I am an interesting dog with an interesting life</h2>

      I had a very exciting morning. I found and chased four different
      squirrels on our walk to the park. I smelled all of my familiar friends
      plus a poodle I didn't know named Daisy.

      I got sick today!  Yuck!  Mom was very grumpy with me, but she cleaned up
      the mess anyway!  She is a good human.  I like my people, they are very
      nice to me.  Gotta go chase a cat, can't talk longer.

      I was contemplating the meaning of life this morning. I was stuck
      deciding whether I do in fact have free will, when I smelled some food
      and completely lost my train of thought.

      I miss my other humans.  They have been gone for a long time and rarely
      come around anymore.  Did I do something to make them... RABBIT!  MUST CHASE!
      GET THE RABBIT!
